This repository hosts a Docker image based on Ubuntu for running Node.js applications. It is designed to provide a lightweight and secure environment for deploying Node.js projects with ease.

## Overview

The Docker image `basir418/basirnode` is an Ubuntu-based environment tailored for Node.js applications. This image includes all necessary dependencies and is optimized for development, testing, and production deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine. You can install Docker by following the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Pulling the Image

To get started, pull the Docker image from Docker Hub using the following command:

```bash
docker pull basir418/basirnode
```

### Running a Node.js Application

To run a Node.js application inside a container using this image, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Directory for Your Application**:  
   If you haven't already, create a directory for your Node.js application.

   ```bash
   mkdir my-node-app
   cd my-node-app
   ```

2. **Create a `Dockerfile`**:  
   Inside your application directory, create a `Dockerfile` with the following content:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM basir418/basirnode

   # Set the working directory inside the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy your application code to the container
   COPY . .

   # Install dependencies
   RUN npm install

   # Expose the port your app runs on
   EXPOSE 3000

   # Start the application
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

3. **Build the Docker Image**:  
   Build your custom Docker image using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-node-app .
   ```

4. **Run the Container**:  
   Start a container from your image:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
   ```

   Your Node.js application will now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Additional Commands

  To stop the container, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal where the container is running, or run:

  ```bash
  docker stop <container_id>
  ```

- **Removing the Container**:  
  To remove the stopped container, run:

  ```bash
  docker rm <container_id>
  ```

- **Listing Running Containers**:  
  To see all running containers:
